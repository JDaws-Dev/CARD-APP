# CardDex UI Tasks

## Coding Guidelines

**READ THESE BEFORE STARTING ANY TASK:**

1. **No Emojis in UI** - Use SVG icons instead of emojis for a professional look. Use Heroicons (`@heroicons/react`) or create custom SVGs.

2. **Icon Library** - Example:

   ```tsx
   import { CheckCircleIcon, StarIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/solid';
   ```

3. **Replace existing emojis** - When working on a file that contains emojis, replace them with appropriate SVG icons.

4. **Kid-friendly but professional** - Use color and animation instead of emojis to convey fun.

5. **File Focus** - Only modify files in `src/app/`, `src/components/`, and styling files. Do NOT modify `convex/` or API routes.
